`wc.py`, `Chains.py`, `Monitoring.py` are purpose-built blockchains intended to be modified or used out of box.

`wc.py` gets information from `wttr.in`; It's also used for tracking weather data along-side the blocks in the blockchain for whatever reason.
`Chains.py` is just a simple comment chain system.
`Monitoring.py` elaborates more on the above with more examples.
